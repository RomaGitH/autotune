# autotune
DSP Final Project

branch main:
autocorrelation works but slow...

yin.m = yin algorithm

acf.m = autocorrelation function

df.m  = diference funtion

cmndf.m  = comulative mean normalized diference function ??

tone.m =

test.m = testing.


branch acf:
idk...

branch acf_fft_window: ok 

acf_fft.m = autocorrelation using fft method (faster)

pitchCorrection.m = 

test.m = testing
